       <h1> Direction read the following passage carefully and answer question 1-10 according to the information given in the passages living abroad a space station </h1>
           <p style="font-family: cursive;">Living abroad space station presents the astronauts with some interesting problems. The main problem is weightlessness. Ass there is no gravity, everything floats unless it is secured in some way. This includes the astronauts themselves. If they want to stay in the same place, they have to tie themselves to something. So when they sleep, they have to tie themselves into a sleeping bag.
            Secondly, there are difficulties with eating and drinking. Most of the food has already been prepared on earth. It is ordinary food except that is made to be sticky so that it remains on the spoon; otherwise, the food  would just float away. For the same reason, drinks are sucked from containers through straw to prevent the liquid from floating away in a ball. You can imagine how messy the space station would soon become if these precautions were not taken.
            Thirdly, there is a special problem concerning going to the toilet. This is a special designed so that an electric fan sucks the liquid and solid wastes into a scaled container.
            Fourthly, the weightlessness of the space station affects the astronauts’ bodies. They need to take regular exercise to keep themselves healthy. This can be difficult because of the shortage of space.
            The last problem that the astronauts have a deal with is boredom. Although their scientific work kept them busy, they will need to make time off to relax. However, apart from taking physical exercise, there is little for the to do except to read, play cards and watch videos.</p>
